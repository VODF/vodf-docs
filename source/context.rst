Context
=======

The VODF forum was created at the end of 2021 as the extension or generalisation of
the Gamma Astro Data Formats initiative
`(GADF) <https://gamma-astro-data-formats.readthedocs.io/>`_. The latter has aimed to
build a common data format of the gamma-ray day from IACTs, allowing joint analyses
or data sharing with success. The VODF aims to build a commun format for IACTs, WCDs
and neutrino detectors with the same objectives. In addition, with the development of
Open Science and certified open data repository (e.g. EOSC, SDC), data formats should
follow as much as possible the
`FAIR principles <https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/>`_ and
the `IVOA standards <https://ivoa.net/documents/index.html>`_.


Governance
==========

VODF is supported by eleven astroparticle experiments whom representatives have set
a governance for the initiative, that can be found
`here <_static/VODF_Governance.pdf>`_. The different VODF bodies are given the
following:

* `VODF Steering committee`_
* `VODF Lead Editors`_
* `Conveners`_


All the meeting notes can be found on
`The VODF-Meetings GitHub repository <https://github.com/VODF/vodf-meetings>`_.
