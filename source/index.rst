   :class: no-scaled-link


The *Very-high-energy Open Data Format*, VODF, is an open data model and format
for Very-High-Energy (VHE) gamma-ray and neutrino astronomy. Its goal is to
provide a standard set of file formats and standards for data starting at the
reconstructed *event* level as well as higher-level products such as
N-dimensional binned data cubes (including sky images, light curves, and
spectra) and source catalogues. With these standards, common science tools can
be used to analyze data from multiple high-energy instruments.  VODF will support
