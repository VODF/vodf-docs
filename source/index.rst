   :alt: VODF: The Very-high-energy Open Data Format
   :class: no-scaled-link


The *Very-high-energy Open Data Format*, VODF, is an open data model and format
for Very-High-Energy (VHE) gamma-ray and neutrino astronomy. Its goal is to
provide a standard set of file formats and standards for data starting at the
reconstructed *event* level as well as higher-level products such as
N-dimensional binned data cubes (including sky images, light curves, and
spectra) and source catalogues. With these standards, common science tools can
be used to analyze data from multiple high-energy instruments.  VODF aims to
follow as much as possible the IVOA standards.

Contributing to VODF
====================
The VODF forum is made both by and for its users, so we welcome and
encourage contributions of many kinds. Our goal is to keep this a positive,
inclusive, successful, and growing community by abiding with the
`VODF Community Code of Conduct <./contributing/code_conduct.html>`_.

The VODF initiative uses a mechanism known as a `Developer Certificate of Origin`
(DCO). The DCO is a binding statement that asserts that you are the creator of
your contribution, and that you wish to allow VODF to use your work to cite
you as contributor. More detailed information on contributing to the project or
submitting feedback can be found on the
`Contributing page <./contributing/index.html>`_.
