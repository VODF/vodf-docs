Level-4
=======

VODF Level-4 specifies catalogs of sources, source components, upper-limits,
observations, or science alerts, generated over the lifetime of the instrument
by combining multiple science projects/programs. Note: the catalogs in general
include source characteristics, source and background models, and potentially
links to associated lower-level products
