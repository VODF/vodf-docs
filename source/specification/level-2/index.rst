VODF Level-2 specifies data products produced by binning the spatial, temporal,
and/or spectral components of the `Level-1` data over a target-specific or a
region of interest of the celestial sphere. These are in *instrumental units*,
e.g. counts.

.. tip:: This is equivalent to *data level 4 (DL4)* defined by CTAO, also called "binned-science data"
