(CTA Data Level 5)

Information, such as spectral energy distributions, light curves, sky maps, and
phaseograms, that are obtained by calculating astrophysical quantities from the
*Binned Science Data* by taking into account the instrumental response functions
(IRFs). These are in *physical units* such as fluxes, rather than instrumental
units.
