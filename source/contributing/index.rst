Promoting contributions
=======================
Even in the Open Source landscape, promoting the work of any is not only **natural** but
also a duty for the VODF leading parties. We are taking care that
*each contribution are correctly awarded for each product of the VODF project*.

An *Authorship Policy* will be settled of each type of products (releases, papers,
conferences). Note that each VODF release will be published with an official DOI
(though the `Zenodo deposit <https://zenodo.org/>`_) that you can use as an Open
Science publication. This publication will associated with a list of *authors* stored
into our metada files (``CITATION.cff`` and ``codemeta.json``).

In order to properly build the author list with you as contributor, VODF is
using **Developer Certificates of Origin** (DCO). This is a lightweight way
for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to
submit the code they are contributing to the project. The used DCO is from the
Linux Foundation and can be found here :ref:`DCOaccept`. The practical
acceptation of our DCO can be found here: :ref:`DCO`.
